Before you can get started you will need an API key. The Google Maps Engine API requires each user to have a unique API key in order to access data stored in GME projects. To obtain an API key, go to the [Google Developers' Console](https://cloud.google.com/console-canary#/flows/enableapi?apiid=mapsengine) and follow the prompts to create a project and a browser key.  

Once you have a key, paste it in the input box.
