##List Features##  
Besides viewing a public table's attributes, you can also access the table's features using a GET request. A feature is a data entry in a table, represented by each row in the table. It is an entity in the real world that has some location, represented by geographical coordinates and other properties. It can be a point, polygon, or polyline. 

The basic URL to access a features list is:                  
https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/{tableId}/features?version=published&key={APIkey} 

One example of the URL:  
`https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/01512215508764088245-12798225287603138914/features?version=published&key=AIzaSyAllwffSbT4nwGqtUOvt7oshqSHowuTwN0`

**EXERCISE**  
Try to modify the URL above to list the features in a table. Use the table ID = 15474835347274181123-14495543923251622067 and your valid API Key for the URL, then click submit.
