Now you have learnt to read public tables, you are ready to learn how to create your own table and add data to it.  
In order to do this, you will need an authorisation token, similar to the API Key from before.  

This authorisation token forms part of OAuth 2.0 and is an essential component of any application. If you've ever signed up or logged in to an application, whether on the web or your mobile, you may have seen a 'User Consent' form which asks for the app to have certain permissions. When you consent, the application receives your unique authorisation token and uses it to query for the information you have allowed it access to.  

Similarly, if you want to create data using Google Maps Engine, you are required to send this token along with any requests relating to private data to verify that you have the appropriate permissions.
