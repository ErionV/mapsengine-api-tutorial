Congratulations! You have just add a feature in your 'World Famous Mountain' table. The server will not give you a response if you have successfully created a feature, but you can check it in [this link](//mapsengine.google.com), go to the 'Data Sources' menu, and click the 'World Famous Mountain' table. Then you can select the 'Edit vector data' option to check the list of the features of the table. The feature you have just appended to the table is a representation of 'Mount Everest'. It has the height of 8848 m.
