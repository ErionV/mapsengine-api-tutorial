##Get Table##  
The GME API stores data in tables where each column represents an attribute and each row represents an individual feature. The attributes each have a name and a type which indicates what form the data takes (string, integer etc.). Once a table is created, you can view the names of all attributes and their types (known as a **schema**), and also some basic information of the table using the 'Get Table' operation.

As you know, accessing data occurs through HTTP requests. The GME API does this through URLs which can be typed into your browser. The basic URL to make a ‘Get Table’ request for public data is:   
`https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/{tableID}?version=published&key={APIkey}`  

The parameter `version=published` is required to specify that a table is publically accessible. If you have a table and wish to make it public, you can follow the instructions in [this link](//support.google.com/mapsengine/answer/3164737?hl=en). The parameter `key={APIkey}` is compulsory as a form of authentication in public data request.

**EXERCISE**  
Copy the above URL into the input box below and replace {tableID} with this ID from an existing table: 15474835347274181123-14495543923251622067 and {APIkey} with your API Key from the previous lesson.
