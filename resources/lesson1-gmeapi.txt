##GME API##  
Google Maps Engine hosts location-based data and allows you to access it in a number of ways, including a web API for reading and writing. The GME web API allows users to manage data using simple HTTP requests.

In order to read data from the Maps Engine, you send a standard HTTP GET request. This takes the form of a structured URL that uses paths and parameters, just the same as you would enter into your browser. The information requested is then returned to you in the HTTP response.

**EXERCISE**
