##Create a Free Project##  
Now it's time to create your own personal Maps Engine project using your Google account. A project can contain multiple tables of data, however the free Maps Engine projects have certain limits. For information on these limits go [here](https://support.google.com/mapsengine/answer/3342103?hl=en).  

If you already have a Maps Engine project, select it from the dropdown list below. Otherwise, create a free Maps Engine project [here](https://mapsengine.google.com/projects/new). Once you have created a project, return to the tutorial and select it from the dropdown list.
